# Machine-Learnin-Coding-Exercise
Coding exercise for Machine Learning on Coursera taught by Prof. Andrew Ng.

The instruction for the exercise is the PDF file named "ex1.pdf".

I have finished all the exercises(including the optional ones) for this problem set (as shown in "result.jpg").



As for the ungraded exercise (Exercise 3.2.1), I find that the best learning rate would be close to 1 and the figure for cost function over number of gradient descent iterations is also shown in the "cost_function.jpg" file.
